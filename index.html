          <p>In this paper, we present a new loss-less compression method CHAPAO (Compressing Alignments using Hierarchical and Probabilistic Approach), which is especially designed for multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of biomolecular data and offers unprecedented compression gain. We propose a novel hierarchical referencing technique to represent biomolecular sequences which combines likelihood based analyses of the sequence similarities and graph theoretic algorithms. We performed an extensive evaluation study using a collection of real biological data from the avian phylogenomics project, 1000 plants project (1KP), and 16S and 23S rRNA dataset. We report the performance of CHAPAO in comparison with general purpose compression techniques as well as with MFCompress which is the best known method especially designed for FASTA files, and with CoMSA which is the best compressor for protein sequence alignments. Experimental results suggest that CHAPAO offers substantial improvement in compression gain over the existing best alternate methods.</p>

			  <li>
          We are trying to build a geometric deep learning approach for solving road network extraction from drone images. The goal is to develop a model which takes 256 by 256 images and outputs entire road network graph in that image patch. We are trying to incorporate spatial graph convolution layer(<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02216.pdf" target="_blank">GRAPHSAGE</a>) and dense graph pooling layer(<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08804.pdf" target="_blank">DIFFPOOL</a>) to convert feature maps of images to graph networks. The network comprises of 4-5 convolution + pooling layers followed by a combination of GraphSAGE and DIFFPOOL layers to convert extracted feature maps into graph road networks. The code is mainly written using Pytorch.

				Similar to cities like New York, London etc. we are developing a 3D Map of Dhaka City. Users will be able to view the map in 2D Satellite view, along with realistic 3D Mesh View. They can find different types of information like number of buildings, trees etc in an area, number of stories in a building, possible area of setting solar panel and much more. Users can also search for location, find best possible route from source to destination etc. We are capturing images using DJI Mavic 2 Pro, making the 3D Objects using <a href="https://www.opendronemap.org/odm/" target="_blank">OpenDroneMap</a> and placing them on the <a href="https://cesium.com/cesiumjs/" target="_blank">Cesium Globe</a>.

          We are working on the development of an Adolescent Chatbot that can answer frequently asked questions by teenagers. We are using <a href="https://wit.ai/" target="_blank">wit.ai</a> to integrate the Chatbot with Facebook Messenger. We have created the dataset so that it covers various queries about which teenagers are usually interested. For increasing usability, we have populated the queries in bangla language. Teenagers will be able to go to our facebook page and chat with the bot about topics they cannot talk about with other people. This will ease their mental stress and help to relieve depression.</li>

            <p>In this hardware project, we have taken inspiration from the famous game of Glow Hockey. 6 8X8 LED Matrices were used to make the game board. Two players would each control their boards by manipulating an object's distance from a sonar sensor. In this way, their board's can be moved up or down. The sensors and LED Matrices were controlled by the ATMega32 microprocessor. The microprocessor was programmed in C Language. </p>

Landlords can register their house in the app, advertise their vacant apartments with suitable images, elaborate description which includes rent, number of rooms etc. Tenants can search for vacant house in any area, reach out to landlord of desired home and even pay rent through our app. For database, we have used SQLite. However, the whole project was done locally for a term project and is not deployable commercially.</p>

            <p>For this term project, we have made an Android app controlled obstacle avoiding car. The car can be operated in manual and auto mode through the android app. It uses sonar sensor to detect obstacle, lipo battery for power supply, bluetooth module for communication between app and car. The Arduino takes input from the sonar sensors, bluetooth module and in turn controls the motor driver which operates the wheels of the car. In the auto mode, the car detects obstacles using it's sonar sensors to move around.</p>
